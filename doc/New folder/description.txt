I need to build complete mobile application using react native + node/express + mongodb within complete frontend and backend and database integration. The purpose of the building this mobile application is that to score higher marks at the research viva presentation. This research basically focus on "AI-based garage recommendation and Repair Time estimation with chatbot"
Here is the basic overview of the project.

Efficient vehicle assistance is essential for ensuring road safety, enhancing convenience, and minimizing downtime, particularly in Sri Lanka, where many small garages operate without real-time coordination. Specially , ladies and under 25 ages don't know about the vehicle faults even they don't have knowledge of the technical part of the car. This project presents an AI-driven mobile application that uses a conversational chatbot to guide vehicle owners in reporting car issues by natural language and uploading photos of the dashboard, determining whether the vehicle is drivable, and arranging repairs. Users describe problems such as “My engine is overheating” or “Brake not working,” and by adding images of dashboard and the chatbot, built with Gemini API, identifies the fault category and type. It then asks if the car can be driven, branching into two paths: if drivable to garage, the system queries nearby garages via Google Maps API for travel distance and ETA, then applies a ranking algorithm to suggest the best garages based on availability (available or busy or closed), mechanics and their experience, user ratings, distance and arrival time; if not drivable to garage, the platform dispatches the nearest available mechanic with real-time ETA and location tracking. Users can book services, track repair progress, and provide feedback. By combining conversational AI, predictive modeling, and location-based services, this system overcomes limitations in existing Sri Lankan solutions that offer static garage listings without intelligent recommendations or dispatch support. The application enhances convenience, reduces waiting times, and fosters trust among vehicle owners, mechanics, and garages. Furthermore, the data collected enables workshops to optimize operations and improve service efficiency. Overall, this project presents the inaugural all-encompassing intelligent garage recommendation and repair time estimation platform in Sri Lanka, thereby enhancing the accessibility, efficiency, and reliability of vehicle assistance.

Here is the plan How to build this project !

🚀 AI-Based Garage Recommendation & Repair Time Estimation Mobile App

This is a smart mobile application designed to help drivers diagnose vehicle issues specifically for Suzuki Alto cars, estimate repair time using ML, and get the best garage recommendations using Google Maps + ranking engine.
If the car is NOT drivable, the system sends a roadside mechanic.
The system includes:
•      🤖 AI Chatbot for fault reporting & fault extraction (user can describe the fault natural language and adding photos of dashboard)
•      🚦 Automatic drivability assessment engine (drivable to garage or not)
•      ⏳ ML Model for estimating repair time (already trained the model)
•      🏭 Garage ranking + recommendation engine
•      Live tracking (Uber-like)
•      Google Maps distance + ETA
•      🧰 Mechanic dispatch system for non-drivable cars (like uber app)
•      📅 Booking & job management modules
•      📊 Progress tracking for garages & mechanics
•      ⭐ Feedback 
•      One single mobile app for drivers(main users) + mechanics + garage 
•      web applications for admin portal (approved garages and ,mechanics into the system )
 
Roles in the System (Very Important)
You have 3 roles, all inside ONE system
Role	| Who
Driver	| Vehicle owner (main user)
Garage	| Repair centre
Mechanic| Individual mechanic

Each role:
•	Logs into same app
•	Sees different screens
•	Has different permissions

Driver (Main User) – FULL FLOW (VERY DETAILED)
This is the heart of your system
________________________________________
🔹 Step 1: Driver Registration
What happens?
User installs the app → chooses Driver
Required fields:
•	Name
•	Phone number
•	Email (OTP verification)
•	Address (picked from Google Maps)
📌 Why Google Maps address?
•	Distance calculation
•	ETA
•	Mechanic dispatch
•	Garage recommendation
👉 Without location → system breaks
👉 So location is mandatory
________________________________________
🔹 Step 2: Add Cars (Inside Profile)
Driver can add one or more cars
For each car:
•	Car Model (Suzuki Alto)
•	Year (2010–2025)
•	Mileage
•	Ownership (1st / 2nd)
📌 Why this matters?
•	ML model accuracy
•	Fault severity
•	Repair time estimation

AI Chatbot (MAIN SCREEN)
This is your most important scoring part 🧠🔥

The chatbot is the heart of the entire system.
It is not a simple Q&A bot — it is an intelligent diagnostic assistant designed specifically for Suzuki Alto (2010–2025).
________________________________________
📋 OVERVIEW: What We’re Building
An intelligent conversational agent that performs real-time vehicle fault diagnosis using:
✅ Dynamic, category-based question flows
✅ Natural human-like conversation
✅ Dashboard image analysis (Gemini Vision API)
✅ Warning light detection & interpretation
✅ Dataset-backed diagnosis (875 real records)
✅ Drivability & safety assessment
✅ Safety-first recommendations
📌 Key Goal:
Help drivers understand their problem safely, even if they have zero vehicle knowledge.
________________________________________
🧠 Core Chatbot Capabilities
1️⃣ Dynamic Question Flow (Not a Fixed Form)
•	Questions change dynamically based on:
o	Fault category
o	Previous answers
o	Severity indicators
Example:
•	Engine issue → cooling, smoke, temperature questions
•	Brake issue → pedal feel, noise, stopping distance
📌 Engine ≠ Brake ≠ Electrical
Each category has its own intelligent question tree.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Natural Conversation (Human-Like)
•	No technical jargon
•	Friendly, supportive tone
•	Safety-aware responses
Instead of:
“Describe engine overheating symptoms”
The chatbot asks:
“Are you safe right now?”
“Did you notice any warning lights?”
“Is there steam coming from the hood?”
________________________________________
3️⃣ Dashboard Image Analysis (Gemini Vision API)
One of the most advanced features of the system.
📷 Users can upload a dashboard photo, and the AI will:
•	Detect warning lights
•	Identify colors (Red / Yellow)
•	Interpret meanings
•	Assign severity automatically
📌 Users do NOT need to know what warning lights mean.
________________________________________
4️⃣ Warning Light Detection & Interpretation
The AI can:
•	Identify multiple warning lights
•	Understand severity levels
•	Cross-reference meanings using dataset + knowledge base
Example:
•	🔴 Red → Major severity
•	🟡 Yellow → Moderate severity
________________________________________
5️⃣ Dataset Integration (875 Records)
•	Every diagnosis is grounded in:
o	Fault categories
o	Fault types
o	Severity levels
o	Parts required
o	Real repair scenarios
📌 This avoids “hallucination”
📌 Makes the system realistic & defendable
________________________________________
6️⃣ Drivability Assessment (Critical Feature)
After diagnosis, AI determines:
•	✅ Drivable to garage
•	🚫 NOT drivable → mechanic dispatch required
This decision is AI-based, not user opinion.
________________________________________
7️⃣ Safety-First Design (Very High Scoring)
At every step, the chatbot prioritizes:
•	User safety
•	Immediate danger warnings
•	Clear do’s and don’ts
Example:
“Do NOT restart the engine.”
“Stay a safe distance away.”
“Never open radiator cap while hot.”

What chatbot does?
•	Talks in human-like language
•	Asks guided questions
•	Allows image upload
•	Uses knowledge base
Example:
“Is the engine overheating when driving or only when idle?”
________________________________________
🔹 Chatbot Output (Very Important)
At the end of the chat, AI must extract:
Field	Source
Fault Category	From chatbot
Fault Type	From chatbot
Severity	From chatbot
Parts Required	From dataset
Drivability	AI logic
________________________________________
🔹 Step 4: Auto-Filled Diagnosis Form (HIGH SCORING POINT)
This proves AI reasoning, not random answers.
Auto-filled fields:
From Car Profile
•	Car Model
•	Car Year
•	Mileage
From Chatbot
•	Fault Category (1 of 7)
•	Fault Type
•	Severity (Minor / Moderate / Major)
📌 User can see how AI understood the problem
📌 This is a VIVA GOLD POINT
________________________________________
🔹 Step 5: ML Repair Time Estimation
Input to ML model:
•	Car model
•	Year
•	Mileage
•	Fault type
•	Severity
Output:
•	⏱ Estimated repair time
•	🔧 Parts required
•	🚗 Drivability assessment
________________________________________
🔹 Step 6: Drivability Decision (Very Smart Design)
Option 1️⃣: Drivable to Garage
➡ Show Garage Recommendation
Option 2️⃣: Not Drivable
➡ Mechanic Dispatch (Uber-style)
This decision is AI-driven, not user guess.

### 4.5 Module 5: Real-Time Tracking & Communication System

**WebSocket Architecture:**
```javascript
// Server-side (Node.js + Socket.io)
const io = require('socket.io')(server, {
    cors: { origin: "*" }
});

// Namespace for job tracking
const jobTracking = io.of('/tracking');

jobTracking.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log(`Client connected: ${socket.id}`);
    
    // Driver subscribes to job updates
    socket.on('subscribe_job', async ({ job_id, user_id }) => {
        // Verify user owns this job
        const job = await Job.findOne({ _id: job_id, user_id });
        if (!job) {
            socket.emit('error', { message: 'Unauthorized' });
            return;
        }
        
        // Join room for this job
        socket.join(`job_${job_id}`);
        
        // Send current status
        socket.emit('current_status', {
            job_id,
            status: job.status,
            updates: job.updates,
            last_update: job.updated_at
        });
    });
    
    // Garage/Mechanic updates job status
    socket.on('update_status', async ({ job_id, status, note, photos }) => {
        const job = await Job.findById(job_id);

            photos: photos || [],
            timestamp: new Date(),
            updated_by: socket.user_id
        });
        
        job.status = status;
        job.updated_at = new Date();
        await job.save();
        
        // Broadcast to all subscribers (driver + admin)
        jobTracking.to(`job_${job_id}`).emit('status_changed', {

        });
        
        // Send push notification to driver
        await sendPushNotification(job.user_id, {
            title: `Job ${job.booking_number} Updated`,
            body: note || `Status changed to: ${status}`,
            data: { job_id, status }
        });
    });
    
    // Live location tracking (mechanic only)
    socket.on('update_location', async ({ job_id, latitude, longitude, heading }) => {
        // Verify user is assigned mechanic
        const job = await Job.findOne({ _id: job_id, mechanic_id: socket.user_id });

Then give Estimated repair time + Drivability assessment + Parts Required 
(I have already trained model ned to set it for estimate repair time)
Drivability assessment has two option :
1.Drivable to Garage     2.Not Drivable to Garage(Mechanic Dispatch)
According to drivability assessment :
  1)Drivable to garage – Garage Recommendation 
shows top ranked garages (ranked based on “availability(busy or available)”,”distance”, ”Estimated Arrival Time”, “Experienced Mechanics”, “user ratings”)
 
2)Not Drivable to garage – Mechanic Dispatch (Like a Uber app)
*Any of this user can allows to pick on location

1)Garage Recommendation
according to the drivability assessment, need to show garages with ranking based on :
1.Availavility : Busy or Not
2.Distance to the top 3 garages 
3.Estimated Arrival Time to top 3 garages
4.Experinced Mechanics (ex: 3 mechanics with 7 yrs, 3 yrs, 12 yrs)
5.User ratings (very important – suggest some mechanism for overall  )
*Need to show each garage details (like when user clicks Uber driver it shows Driver name vehicle name  like, you need to show each garage details )
(Here 2 and 3 are dynamic inputs based on the locations)

Booking
Once user clicks on the “Book Now” on selected one garage then need to build communication user to garage
(Appointment must be goes to garage)
Also Need to send short message of informing the fault and need to attached the prefilled forum for with better clarification the garage.
Message like be “Suzuki Alto car | Engine Misfiring”
Pre-Filled Forum like be :

Once garage accept the job,Need to show the road/Navigation to the garage using google map.

Tracking
Also Job has three status :
Pending ; Waiting in the Queue  or check the diagnose
In progress : doing repairing (In here garage can add descriptions or images about the repairing to infrom customer, that means user always know what happing )
Completed : Done the job

Rating
After completion, garage give bill for thr service, after garage marked payment(just toggle the button) is done via our application , User can give their ratings using 1 to 5 stars.

2)Mechanic Dispatch
according to the drivability assessment, car is not drivable that means need mechanic dispatch to fix and goes to garage
this part like an Uber app, user explore mechanic, book one and mechanic come.
1)identity nearby available mechanics
2)calculates ETA to driver locations
3)mechanics on a live map
After job done, mechanic can add job fee and when user marked payment t(just toggle the button) user can add give their ratings using 1 to 5 stars.
Ratings is more important to calculate quality of the service
