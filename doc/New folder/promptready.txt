I Need to create PWA(Progressive Web Application- it will work on mobile phones too! ) on "AI-Based Garage Recommendation and Repair Time Estimation with Chatbot " that meets following requirements using React + Node.js/Express.js + Mongodb + WebSocket + OpenStreet with Leaflet Maps Integration and ML Integration(modle already trained), AI Chatbot(GEMINI API with Image Uploading, Image analyzing)This PWA has four roles : Drivers(Main Users) ,Garages , Mechanics, Admin Portal

I have already trained the model for repair time estimation, I also attached the model and dataset

Create a mobile-first Progressive Web App for vehicle diagnostics with these features:

AUTHENTICATION & PROFILE:
- User registration 
- Profile management with Google Maps address picker (use openstreet with leaflet)
- Add/manage multiple vehicles (Suzuki Alto 2010-2025) -Normal CRUD Operation
- Vehicle fields: model, year, mileage, transmission, registration

AI CHATBOT DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM:
- Conversational interface for fault reporting
- Natural language processing
- Image upload for dashboard photos (Gemini Vision API integration)
- Dynamic question flow based on fault category
- Extract: Fault Category, Fault Type, Severity (Minor/Moderate/Major)
- Display auto-filled diagnosis form showing like a pre-filled forum:
  * Car Model, Year, Mileage , Transmission(from profile)
  * Fault Category, Fault Type, Severity (from chatbot), 
Output :
  - Parts required from AI CHATBOT

  - Drivability assessment (Drivable/Not Drivable) from AI CHATBOT

 show button  Repair Time Estimation, After Clicks it,
Show forum again with pre-filled fields :  (This is place shows the How Model working !)
Car Model :   | Car Year :  | Mileage :  | Transmission : 
Fault Category :            | Fault Type :
Severity  :                 | Parts Required : 
Location  :  pick from Openstreet with leaflet (already selected SLIIT, New Kandy Road Malabe Exact Location : 6.914833, 79.972861) * If user needs, user can change this field (Not Prefilled)

Here is demo !
When user clicks "Estimate Repair Time":
1. Show the pre-filled form with all input features
2. Add a "Calculate" button
3. Show loading spinner (1-2 seconds)
4. Display result with confidence score

GARAGE RECOMMENDATION (If Drivable):
- Show top 5 ranked garages based on: (for demonstration pick 5 garages/places within 2.5km around SLIIT ,Malabe, Sri Lanka with ratins and mechanics)
  * Availability (Available/Busy) If Busy need to show waiting time 
  * Distance (use openstreet with leaflet)
  * ETA calculation
  * Mechanic experience
  * User ratings (1-5 stars)

Here is the dummy data  of the garages !
Need to deal with these data and need to label Garages with proper name and show the location with driver location within Openstreet with leaflet

🚗 EXACT GARAGE RECOMMENDATION – LIVE DEMO (VIVA READY)
📍 Driver Location

SLIIT, New Kandy Road, Malabe
6.914833, 79.972861

Garage 01 : Location 6.917808, 79.972542 | Busy (waiting time = 15min) | Distance : 500m | User ratings : 3.2/5 |2 Mechanics with 7yrs, 9yrs experience | Arrival Time : 2 min 

Garage 02 : Location 6.915941, 79.969006 | Available (waiting time = 0min) |Distance : 550m | User ratings : 4.2/5 | 3 Mechanics with 7yrs, 12 yrs, 3yrs experience | Arrival Time : 2 min 

Garage 03 : Location 6.915764, 79.969251 | Busy (waiting time = 15min) |Distance : 600m | User ratings : 4.4/5 | 5 Mechanics with 12yrs, 14 yrs, 10 yrs, 8yrs, 6yrs experience | Arrival Time : 3 min 

Garage 04 : Location 6.916514, 79.973312 | Busy (waiting time = 0min) | Distance : 600m | User ratings : 4/5 | 3 Mechanics with 4yrs, 6 yrs, 6 yrs Experience | Arrival Time : 3 min

Behind the scene 
🔢 STEP 1: Convert values to SAME UNITS
Garage	Distance (km)	Waiting (min)	Arrival (min)	Rating	Mechanics 
G1	   0.50	                15	        2	3.2	2          
G2	   0.55	                 0	        2	4.2	3
G3	   0.60	                15	        3	4.4	5
G4	   0.60	                 0	        3	4.0	3
G5	   1.70	                15	        6	3.5	4


🔢 STEP 2: Find MAX values (for normalization)
maxDistance = 1.70 km
maxWaiting  = 15 min
maxArrival  = 6 min
maxMechanics = 5

⚖️ STEP 3: Weights (FIXED)
Distance  = 0.25
Waiting   = 0.30
Arrival   = 0.15
Rating    = 0.20
Mechanics = 0.10

🧮 STEP 4: Normalization Formulas
distanceNorm   = distance / maxDistance
waitNorm       = waiting / maxWaiting
arrivalNorm    = arrival / maxArrival
ratingNorm     = (5 - rating) / 5
mechanicNorm   = (maxMechanics - mechanics) / maxMechanics

🧮 STEP 5: FINAL SCORE CALCULATION
🏚️ Garage 01
distance = 0.50 / 1.70 = 0.29
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1.00
arrival  = 2 / 6 = 0.33
rating   = (5 - 3.2)/5 = 0.36
mechanic = (5 - 2)/5 = 0.60
Final Score =(0.29×0.25)+(1.00×0.30)+(0.33×0.15)+(0.36×0.20)+(0.60×0.10) = 0.553

🏚️ Garage 02
distance = 0.55 / 1.70 = 0.32
waiting  = 0 / 15 = 0
arrival  = 2 / 6 = 0.33
rating   = (5 - 4.2)/5 = 0.16
mechanic = (5 - 3)/5 = 0.40
Final Score= 0.214 ✅

🏚️ Garage 03
distance = 0.60 / 1.70 = 0.35
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1
arrival  = 3 / 6 = 0.50
rating   = (5 - 4.4)/5 = 0.12
mechanic = (5 - 5)/5 = 0
Final Score= 0.487

🏚️ Garage 04
distance = 0.60 / 1.70 = 0.35
waiting  = 0 / 15 = 0
arrival  = 3 / 6 = 0.50
rating   = (5 - 4.0)/5 = 0.20
mechanic = (5 - 3)/5 = 0.40
Final Score= 0.256

🏚️ Garage 05
distance = 1.70 / 1.70 = 1
waiting  = 15 / 15 = 1
arrival  = 6 / 6 = 1
rating   = (5 - 3.5)/5 = 0.30
mechanic = (5 - 4)/5 = 0.20
Final Score  = 0.790 ❌

🏆 FINAL RANKING (LOWEST SCORE = BEST)
Rank	Garage	      Final Score
🥇 1	Garage 02	0.214
🥈 2	Garage 04	0.256
🥉 3	Garage 03	0.487
4	Garage 01	0.553
5	Garage 05	0.790

🔥 VIVA KILLER POINT (VERY IMPORTANT)

👉 Garage 01 is the nearest (500m)
❌ BUT not recommended due to:

High waiting time | Low rating | Fewer mechanics

✅ Garage 02 wins because:

Zero waiting | High rating | Fast arrival

**Most Important :  Ebven Chatbot building, Need to The app should detect specific demo phrases and trigger pre-defined conversation flows:

TRIGGER PHRASE 1: "brake" OR "grinding" OR "brake noise"
→ Activates CASE 1: BRAKE ISSUE FLOW (Drivable)

TRIGGER PHRASE 2: "overheating" OR "overheat" OR "engine stopped"
→ Activates CASE 2: ENGINE OVERHEATING FLOW (Not Drivable)


CASE 1: BRAKE GRINDING (DRIVABLE FLOW)
