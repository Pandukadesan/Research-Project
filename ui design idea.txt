🔑 HOW TECHNICALLy THIS IS DONE (BEGINNER FRIENDLY)
Step 1: User Table (IMPORTANT)

Every user has:

user_id

name

email

password

role (driver | garage | mechanic | admin)

Step 2: Role-Based Navigation (React Native)

You create separate navigation stacks:

Role	Navigation Stack
Driver	Chatbot, Booking, Tracking
Garage	Jobs, Assignments, Reports
Mechanic	Job Alerts, Map, Status

App loads only one stack based on role.

Step 3: Backend Role Validation (VERY IMPORTANT)

Frontend hides screens
BUT backend enforces permissions.

Example:

Only garage can update repair status

Only mechanic can accept roadside jobs

This prevents cheating.

🧪 WILL EXAMINERS ACCEPT THIS?
✅ YES — IF YOU SAY THIS:

“To reduce deployment complexity and ensure rapid prototyping,
we implemented a single mobile application with role-based access control,
providing tailored interfaces for drivers, garages, and mechanics.”

This sounds very professional.

🏆 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES (FOR CONFIDENCE)

Airbnb → Host & Guest same app

Daraz Seller & Buyer → same app initially
